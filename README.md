# Elevens-Lab-Activity7

1. What items would be necessary if you were playing a game of Elevens at your desk (not on the
computer)? List the private instance variables needed for the ElevensBoard class.

2. Write an algorithm that describes the actions necessary to play the Elevens game.

3. Now examine the partially implemented ElevensBoard.java file found in the Activity7
Starter Code directory. Does the ElevensBoard class contain all the state and behavior
necessary to play the game?

4. ElevensBoard.java contains three helper methods. These helper methods are private
because they are only called from the ElevensBoard class.

a. Where is the dealMyCards method called in ElevensBoard?






b. Which public methods should call the containsPairSum11 and containsJQK
methods?





c. Itâ€™s important to understand how the cardIndexes method works, and how the list that it
returns is used. Suppose that cards contains the elements shown below. Trace the execution
of the cardIndexes method to determine what list will be returned. Complete the diagram
below by filling in the elements of the returned list, and by showing how those values index
cards. Note that the returned list may have less than 9 elements.
